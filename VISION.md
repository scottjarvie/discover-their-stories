# Discover Their Stories - Vision & Goals

*Last updated: 2026-02-02*

## The Big Picture

**Discover Their Stories** isn't just genealogy software. It's about transforming family history from a names-and-dates collection exercise into a deep, meaningful connection with ancestors as *real people*.

### Core Philosophy

> "Go beyond names and dates. Research deeply, tell stories, create content."

The goal isn't just to find records or add names to a family tree. It's to:

- **Understand who your ancestors were** as people
- **Paint pictures of their lives** through context and storytelling
- **Connect emotionally** with your heritage
- **Share their stories** in compelling ways

## What We're Building

A suite of AI-powered tools that help people:

### 1. Deep Research
- Understand historical context (not just individual records)
- Research the *places* ancestors lived — what was that town like? What industries existed?
- Research their *time periods* — what was happening in the world?
- Research their *religions* — what did they believe? How did they practice?
- Research their *occupations* — what did a cooper or a milliner actually do?

### 2. Contextual Understanding
- What was life like for them day-to-day?
- What challenges did their generation face?
- What opportunities did they have (or lack)?
- What historical events shaped their lives?

### 3. Storytelling & Content Creation
- **Stories** — Narrative accounts of ancestors' lives
- **Books** — Compilations of family histories
- **Podcasts** — Audio storytelling about ancestors
- **Timelines** — Visual representations of lives in context
- **Photo analysis** — Understanding and dating old photographs

### 4. AI-Assisted Discovery
- Use AI to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Identify patterns, conflicts, and research opportunities
- Generate narrative drafts from raw evidence
- Deep research assistance for historical context

## Guiding Principles

### Privacy First
- All data stays local on the user's computer
- No accounts required
- User controls what (if anything) goes to AI services
- Sensitive information can be redacted before AI processing

### Respectful of Sources
- FamilySearch-compliant (no scraping, user-initiated only)
- Proper attribution and citation
- Distinguish between evidence and conclusions

### Accessible
- Tools should be usable by regular people, not just tech experts
- Clear explanations of what AI is doing
- Transparent about AI limitations

### LDS Context
- Many users will be members doing temple work
- That's valid, but it's not the *only* goal
- The deeper goal is connection and understanding
- Temple names can be a byproduct of deeper research

## Current State (Feb 2026)

The project has a foundation but is largely a **blank slate** for experimentation:

### Built So Far
- ✅ Next.js marketing site and app shell
- ✅ Chrome extension skeleton for FamilySearch extraction
- ✅ Evidence Pack schema for structured data
- ✅ AI processing pipeline design (OpenRouter)
- ✅ Settings page with API key management
- ✅ Local file storage system

### Not Yet Built
- ⏳ Full extraction logic in the extension
- ⏳ Contextualized dossier generation
- ⏳ Story Writer tool
- ⏳ Photo Analyzer
- ⏳ Timeline Builder
- ⏳ Research Planner
- ⏳ Podcast/audio features

## Tool Ideas to Explore

*These are experiments to try — not all will work or ship*

### Source Documentation Tool (in progress)
Extract FamilySearch sources → AI analysis → Evidence Documents + Dossiers

### Story Generator
Input: Evidence documents, family tree data
Output: Narrative stories suitable for sharing or publishing

### Historical Context Engine
Input: Place + Date
Output: Deep research on what life was like (economy, religion, politics, daily life)

### Photo Dating & Analysis
Input: Old photograph
Output: Estimated date range, clothing analysis, location clues, context

### Timeline Synthesizer
Input: Multiple sources for one person
Output: Visual timeline with historical events overlaid

### Podcast Script Generator
Input: Family stories or research
Output: Podcast-ready scripts with narrative structure

### Research Planner
Input: What you know about an ancestor
Output: Suggested research paths, record types to check, questions to answer

### "Day in the Life" Generator
Input: Ancestor's occupation, location, time period
Output: Vivid description of what a typical day might have looked like

## Technical Approach

### AI Integration
- **OpenRouter** for flexibility across models (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.)
- User provides their own API key
- Redaction options for privacy

### Local-First Architecture
- Data stored in local filesystem (JSON, Markdown)
- No database required
- Easy to backup and export

### Browser Extension
- Chrome Manifest V3
- Extracts data from FamilySearch with user consent
- Paced operations to respect FamilySearch

### Future Possibilities
- AI agents that can do multi-step research
- Integration with other genealogy sites (Ancestry, FindAGrave, etc.)
- Collaboration features for family groups
- Mobile app companion

## Success Metrics

Not vanity metrics — real impact:

- Do users feel more connected to their ancestors?
- Are they discovering things they didn't know?
- Are the stories compelling enough to share with family?
- Does the tool save time while improving depth?

## Notes & Ideas

*Space for ongoing thoughts*

- Consider integration with Hive blockchain for publishing stories
- AI News Daily workflow patterns might inform content generation here
- Voice narration for stories could be powerful (ElevenLabs TTS)
- Could generate "ancestor trading cards" with AI images

---

*This document will evolve as we experiment and learn what works.*
